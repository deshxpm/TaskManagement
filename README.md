#Project Description: Task Allocation and Management System

#Overview
The Task Allocation and Management System is a comprehensive Django-based web application designed to streamline task management and expert allocation. The system is intended for organizations or teams that need to efficiently manage and assign tasks to experts, with functionalities for bulk operations and user authentication.

#Key Features
#User Authentication:

Signup: Users can create accounts with email and password. The system supports user registration and automatically logs in new users upon successful registration.
Login: Users can log in using their email and password. The authentication process ensures secure access to the system.
Logout: Users can log out, ending their session and redirecting them to the login page.
Task Management:

Create and Manage Tasks: Users can add tasks with titles and descriptions. Tasks can be viewed, edited, or deleted.
Bulk Task Creation: Allows users to create multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency for large-scale task management.
Expert Management:

Add and Manage Experts: Users can register new experts, detailing their names and areas of expertise. The expert list can be updated as needed.
#Task Allocation:

Bulk Allocation: Assign multiple tasks to one or more experts in a single operation. This feature is designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
Individual Task Allocation: Assign tasks to experts one by one as required.
User Interface:

Bootstrap 5: The application utilizes Bootstrap 5 for a modern, responsive design that works well across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
Custom HTML Forms: Simple HTML forms with JavaScript-based validation ensure a clean user experience and prevent invalid data submission.
Performance Optimization:

Database Indexing: Indexed key fields for faster query performance.
Caching and Pagination: Techniques employed to handle large datasets and improve system responsiveness.
Bulk Operations: Efficient handling of large volumes of data, reducing database overhead.
Scalability:

Designed to efficiently manage a large number of tasks and experts (e.g., 10,000+ records) with minimal performance issues.
Responsive Design:

Ensures that the user interface adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless experience.

#Technology Stack
Backend: Django (Python-based web framework)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
Database: SQLite (or PostgreSQL for production environments)
Client-Side Validation: JavaScript (for real-time form validation)
User Authentication: Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system
